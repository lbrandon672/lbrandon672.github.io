        <h1>Reading Response</h1>
        <p>What I got out of the reading from Frank was that he really wants design that sings it's own song, a sort of design that flows smoothly from start to finish. So much of what we think is grandiose and extravagent is really unnecessary in design for the modern age because we've evolved past that, into an age of more efficient and functional design. I think that he really makes a point when he show's some of the dutch designer's work, Kaspar Laigaard, because it shows that he is utilizing the grid to execute a clean, well thought out, simple and clear layout. I also enjoy the reference he made to the Hockney photography because it gives reasoning to the notion of edgeless design, the reasoning being that we don't always have to conform to the picturesque image or layout. That by breaking these conformities, we can begin to execute design that is more spontaneous and engaging while still being clear in it's role and function. First to break this however, we must first know the basics, the grid. Which was why I found his dutch designer reference so charming. Although, in contrast I also found the apple website to also be appealing, that was all it had going for it. I had no quarrels with the giant space ship thing which I think was supposed to be the new Apple tower but what I did have a worry about was it's functionality. For things to hiccup in mid animation, lag between scrolling or no scrolling at all, tabs that were too uniform and I could not tell which page was supposed to tell me what information. These are all no no's that I can already start to feel, however the site is pretty at first impression, this is all it has going for it. A bear riding a bicycle. </p>
